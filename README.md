# ece455project

This was the implementation of three separate labs for ECE455 at UVic.

Some notes:

-The project 1 and project 2 code have some known bugs, especially the project 2 code. These were not fixed due to lack of time.

-The project files are designed to be loaded in the STM32CubeIDE.

-The lab manual is pretty unclear about a lot of things, which led to design decisions which may not have been entirely correct.
